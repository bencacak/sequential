                <p>&emsp;The question his grandfather had asked about being excited for the upcoming school year had been somewhat rhetorical. His grandfather knew that no 14-year-old wants to go to school. It is a state-mandated six hours in a building that resembles a prison. One where the busy work in plentiful and the plethora of social cliques roam untamed.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;All of these questions were not unfamiliar to him. He had been asked variations of these mandatory grandparent questions many times over. He knew what to expect, however, he was never expecting them. He knew deep inside that one question, in particular, was bound to come up. It had come up reliably in every situation like this leading up to this late summer day in 2012. He never seemed to prepare for it though. It was like he fell victim to denial every time this "deja-vu" conversation came up. He hoped it would never show up in the conversation, but it did so without fail every time. How could have he been not expecting it?</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;The conversation continued. More and more tension built up inside of him as more and more of the typical questions were used because the probability of the question coming up as a form of small talk increased. However, he did nothing to derail the conversation away from the small talk. He sat there passively in the backseat of the car with the false hope that the question would not come up. However, the questions became more and more personal as the car trekked down the narrow state highway. He tried not to think about it.</p><br>
