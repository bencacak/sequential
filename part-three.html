                <p>&emsp;"How are your friends?" his grandmother asked with solely pure intentions. This spiked his anxiety even further. An old receipt he had found in the side compartment of the door found its way into his hands. He frayed the edges by tearing it in short increments along the sides, a nervous tic he had grown into while coming of age.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;“Fine,” keeping the answer short and sweet, doing nothing to turn the conversation around from its inevitable fate.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;“Staying out of trouble, I hope?” his grandfather added.</p> <br>
                <p>&emsp;"Yes," it seemed like the conversation was going the other way. But he continued to fray the old receipt. It slowly lost its paper-like integrity. The question was coming, but he sat there compliantly.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;"Try not to get in with a bad crowd when you go back to school next year." His grandfather did not care to elaborate. His grandmother nodded in simultaneous agreement.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;"Do you have a girlfriend?" The question came out of his grandfather's mouth just like that. The receipt in his hands tore just as quickly as the elephant in the room appeared, making the once spacious SUV felt cramped and claustrophobic. There was no room to breathe and he started to perspire. His heart palpitated, even skipping a beat as heard the line. What does he say to that question&mdash;how does he respond? His mind drew a blank. The blink of an eye felt like an eternity as time stood still in the moment. He came back to reality as his mind slipped and fell for just a few milliseconds. He had to think quick. He looked over the door handle. It was locked. There was no chance he could jump out. The car was traveling too fast, as well. That was not a practical solution to the problem at hand. He could lie and say that he has a girlfriend, but he wouldn't even believe the lie himself. How could he expect his unsuspecting grandparents to believe it, too? It also felt like an oxymoron to him, foreign, somewhat dichotomous. It felt unnatural. He could tell the truth; he could take a risk. It would be a real risk, too. He replayed all of the possible scenarios in his head of what could go wrong. The shock of the truth could send the car off of the road. That was always a risk. He would not know how his grandparents would react if he told the truth. Would they accept the truth? Would they reject him if he confided his truth that he had been carrying for all these years? There was a lot on the line. His relationship with his grandparents could be damaged, his personal safety could be in jeopardy if he told his truth. He tore the two halves of the mutilated receipt out of the surge of cortisol that came from the question being posed, breaking it into uneven fourths.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;It had been a couple of seconds since his grandfather posed the question. He had made his decision on the response he would give: "No." It was short but not sweet. It was safe but not sound. He had betrayed himself again. He had not told his truth. He had decided to hold onto it, to carry it with him as extra weight. </p><br>
                <p>&emsp;Skipping forward to the present day, he has yet to tell his truth to his grandparents. He has yet to tell his truth to his other, maternal grandparents as well. He has yet to tell his truth to his bible thumping aunt, or any of his extended family for that matter. How could he share his truth that he has carried for all of these years to his family? He had no idea what to expect from them, how they would react. Safety was a concern for him if decided to tell his truth: that he could never love a woman the way he could love a man.</p><br>
