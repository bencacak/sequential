                <p>&emsp;Driving down a narrow state route in western Oregon, somewhere between the Interstate Five straight in the Willamette Valley and the Pacific Ocean, meant that he was in the car with his grandparents. This usually means that they are going to a place far away from their home in Salem with him, which equates to long trips in the Honda SUV without stop and an included hour of obligated familial conversation. He was visiting them for the weekend. It is nice to see family every once in a while, even though the strings of inevitable drama or tension are usually attached. He sat in the back seat on the driver's side of the vehicle, looking out the window, watching the dashed yellow line of the poorly maintained state route come in and out of view as they traveled at high speeds through the window. The car had been quiet for several moments&mdash;just a few moments too long. Questions that can be adequately described as small talk are bound to pop up to break the awkward silence.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;A few more moments passed.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;“How’s your life going?” his grandfather asked from the driver’s seat of the car, likely with the intention to break the awkward silence that had consumed us all.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;"Fine," he replied adding "I guess," to the end of the statement.</p> <br>
                <p>&emsp;His grandfather gave a slight chuckle to his response. He had raised two kids of his own, so he was used to the all too typical and ubiquitous, yet mysterious teenager responses that could make anyone doubt their validity. He saw a slight grin appear between his grandfather's lips through the rear-view mirror. "What about your studies&mdash;school? You’re starting as a freshman in high school next year. That has to be exciting." His grandmother's interested had been peaked, re-positioning herself in her seat up front to be more engaged in the seemingly uninteresting dialogue.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;"Not really," he answered, "I am pretty nervous about starting."</p><br> 
                <p>&emsp;“Why?” his grandmother followed up on.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;“Why wouldn’t I be?”</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;“What is there to be nervous about?”</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;“New school, new people, new everything, lots of change...” he rattled off. He had been recently been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, so all of the things he listed were potential triggers for the debilitating sense of panic associated with the illness.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;"It's not that bad," his grandmother said in hopes of making him feel better, ignorant of his social anxiety. "You get a lot more freedom in high school compared to middle school, and I mean a lot."</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;He shrugged.</p><br>
